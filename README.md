# PennApps2018
PennApps project built in 2018

## Inspiration
We kept getting lost in the Penn Engineering building because we don't understand hallways and rectangles. So we made an app that can show us the way back to where we left our stuff, so we never forget where it is. 

## What it does
When opened, the app will track where the user is going and place "breadcrumbs" along the path they are walking. When the user wants to return to their original location, they hold their phone up and follow the breadcrumbs back. 

## How I built it
Android ARCore was used to display the AR features.
Unity was used to build the 3D models.
Fuse was used to build the human models.

## Challenges I ran into
None of the development team had experience using AR with Android. Those on our team that were familiar with Android development had experience with Android studio and not Unity. We experimented with different AR technologies, such as Vuforia and ARCore. After exploring those two technologies, we ultimately chose ARCore due to its ease of use and good documentation. 

We also encountered issues pertaining to limited resources. We are aware that ARKit for Apple devices has plenty of documentation, but we couldn't use it because we did not have enough Apple products. 

We also ran into compatibility issues between Android Studio and Unity. Merely setting up the project and making sure they worked on all computers we were developing on was a problem.   

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to make an Android app in Unity despite our lack of experience with the technologies, and are proud to learn more about Unity as we code. 

## What we learned
AR is tough. We learned how to use Unity. We learned how to make graphics in Unity. 

## What's next for Living Philadelphia
Make the breadcrumbs customizable so that users can make them into different things. The app has potential for multiple indoor and outdoor use cases. If you need to retrace your steps, both indoors and outdoors, the app makes this possible. If you need to find where you parked your car, you can use breadcrumbs to find it. If you need to find your campsite, you can use breadcrumbs to locate it.
